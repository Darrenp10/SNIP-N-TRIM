This page is for information you need to remember
The title is self explanatory
Create a checklist of things that you want completed and once they have been completed, check them off!

#1 Create checklist page (DONE)
#2 I want you to design this webpage for all three major screen sizes
    - Full screen (1024×768 through 1920×1080)
    - Tablet (360×640 through 414×896)
    - mobile device (360×640 through 414×896)

    - To successfully do this, we're going to have to @media our code.
    - Do some research on @media and find out if we can house our entire CSS in an @media section
    - If we can, then we'll have 3 @media sections for each screen size.
    - We will only change font sizes in the @media sections while the rest of the code stays the same 
    - Goodluck!
